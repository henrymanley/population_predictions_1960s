# Population Predictions for the 1960s (county-age-year)
### Data Appendix for Kose, Manley, Miller (forthcoming)
---

## Background
There are no publicly available population counts -- by county, age, and year -- for the years 1961-1968. 

Before the Survey of Epidemiological End Results (SEER) posted their first intercensal tabulation in 1969, the only measure of population counts available was the decadal Census. Yet, researchers oftem  study programs that were administered in the 1960s and scale exposure (e.g., funding) based on the presumed treatment population. One such example from the economics literature are Head Start roll-out studies 

In Kose, Manley, Miller (forthcoming), we use a neural network to _predict_ population counts by county, age, and year in the 1960s. Our model combines over 200 demographic features to generate predictions for 1-20 year-olds in the years 1961-1968.
