# Population predictions for the 1960s by county-age-year

Data Appendix: Kose, Manley, Miller (2024)
---

## Background
Before the Survey of Epidemiological End Results (SEER) posted their first intercensal tabulation in 1969, the only available measure of population counts $-$ by county, age, and year $-$ was from the decadal Census. Consequently, there are no publicly available population counts for the years 1961-1968. Kose, Manley, Miller (2024) documents this occurence and puts forth a neural network model that predicts population counts for ages 1-20 in the years 1961-1968. Their predictions draw from a collection of over 200 predictive features and outperform a linear interpolation benchmark by 57\%. 

## Data provided in this repository
This repository contains two ZIP files: `kose_manley_miller_population_predictions_1960s.zip` and `kose_manley_miller_population_predictions_1970s_1980s.zip`. Each ZIP file contains one CSV file with seven variables: 

- `superfips`: county identifier
- `county_name`:
- `state_abb`: 
- `age`: single year of age (integer: 0-20).
- `year`: year
- `truth`: "true" population count reported by \{1960: the 1960 Census, 1969-1989: SEER\}
- `li`: age-based linear interpolation of population counts between decadal endpoints (e.g., the interpolation of the counts of 5-year olds between 1960 and 1969)
- `yhat`: population prediction generated by the neural network model
